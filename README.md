# üëã Hi, I'm Aiden Zhao

### A Machine Learning Engineer shaping the future of AI, one dataset at a time.

I'm a Machine Learning & AI Engineer specializing in **Foundation Models, AI Agents, and large-scale training systems**. I operate on a core belief that has become the foundation of my work:

> *The quality of data defines the ceiling of a model's potential, while the algorithm determines how close we get to that ceiling. It is paramount to get the data right, and that is where I dedicate my expertise.*

Currently, as a **Senior Data Scientist at Capital One**, my primary focus is on **specialized dataset curation for training Foundational Language Models**. I architect and implement the strategies that govern the data our models learn from, ensuring that from the very beginning, they are built on a foundation of quality, relevance, and integrity.

### üöÄ Career Highlights

Throughout my career, I've focused on creating tangible impact by bridging the gap between research and production.

- **üèÜ 1st Place Winner, ElevenLabs Hackathon:** As the AI Engineer for a four-person team, co-developed 'Hugo Tour Guide,' an AI travel companion that won first prize. The project provides users with personalized, location-aware travel experiences by planning routes and answering cultural and historical questions on the go.
- **üí° Architect of 'EZ-Career' at Microsoft AI Agents Hackathon:** Designed and co-developed "EZ-Career," a sophisticated multi-agent autonomous system to fully automate the job application process. The project leveraged a complex architecture with Playwright for browser control and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for factual consistency, showcasing a deep dive into practical, real-world agentic workflows.
- **Enhanced AI Agent Capabilities at TIFIN:** As a Senior Machine Learning Engineer, I enhanced conversational AI agents, fine-tuned open-source models to boost performance while reducing latency, and designed tools to expand agent functionality.

### üñ•Ô∏è My Homelab: A Personal AI Supercomputer

Beyond my professional work, I've designed and built a high-performance homelab from the ground up. It serves as my personal cloud and sandbox for pushing the limits of AI/ML development, allowing for experimentation that rivals enterprise-grade environments. The entire system is architected for maximum throughput, from networking to storage to compute.

#### **Core Workstation Specifications**

| Component | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **CPU** | AMD Ryzen‚Ñ¢ Threadripper‚Ñ¢ PRO 7965WX (24 Cores / 48 Threads) |
| **GPU** | NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell 96GB GDDR7 VRAM |
| **RAM** | 256 GB Kingston FURY Renegade Pro DDR5 ECC Registered (5600MT/s) |
| **Storage (OS & Hot Data)** | 2TB Kingston FURY Renegade PCIe 5.0 NVMe M.2 SSD (Up to 14.8 GB/s) |
| **Motherboard** | ASRock WRX90 WS EVO |
| **Power Supply** | Seasonic PRIME 1600W 80+ Platinum (ATX 3.0) |
| **Cooling** | Thermaltake AW420 AIO Liquid Cooler |
| **Chassis** | Fractal Design Meshify 3 XL |

#### **Network & Storage Fabric**

- üöÄ **High-Throughput Compute:** The core of the lab is the workstation, pairing the massive parallel processing power of a **Threadripper PRO** with the cutting-edge **NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 GPU**. Built on the **Blackwell architecture**, it features **96GB of GDDR7 memory**, fifth-generation Tensor Cores, and fourth-generation RT Cores, providing unparalleled acceleration for training, inference, and complex data visualization.
- üóÑÔ∏è **Centralized Storage Backbone:** A 1U rackmount server running **TrueNAS SCALE** acts as the central data hub. It's configured with a **96TB ZFS RAID-Z2 array**, providing extreme data redundancy and integrity, and is connected directly to the workstation and network core via a **10GbE switch**.
- üåê **Multi-Gig Network Core:** The network is managed by a **Ubiquiti Dream Machine Pro**. A dedicated **10GbE switch** provides a high-speed data lane between the workstation and the NAS, eliminating I/O bottlenecks. A separate **2.5GbE PoE switch** powers **Wi-Fi 7 (U7 Pro) access points**, ensuring general network access doesn't interfere with high-performance tasks.

#### **What This Architecture Unlocks**

This end-to-end, high-performance environment allows me to:
- **Explore novel quantization techniques like FP4** on state-of-the-art hardware, powered by next-gen Tensor Cores.
- **Finetune larger models** that would be impractical on consumer-grade hardware, thanks to the GPU's massive 96GB VRAM.
- **Rapidly iterate on data-intensive workflows**, with near-instantaneous dataset loading from the PCIe 5.0 SSD and the 10GbE-connected NAS.
- **Run stable, long-duration experiments** with confidence, backed by ECC memory and an enterprise-grade power and cooling solution.
- **Self-host a complete suite of MLOps tools**, from local vector databases to model registries, creating a fully integrated, private research cloud.
